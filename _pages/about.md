I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), advised by [Dr. Rui Li](https://ruililuci.com//) at the [Lab for Use-inspired Computational Intelligence (LUCI)](https://ruililuci.com//). My current research focuses on **Bayesian Deep Learning**, **Hierarchical Bayesian Inference**, and **Federated Learning**, emphasizing principled methods for integrating knowledge across distributed systems.

Before starting my Ph.D., I gained over **six years of professional experience** in AI and machine learning. I worked at [**Fusemachines**](https://fusemachines.com/) in Nepal as a Machine Learning Engineer, AI Instructor, and Assistant Manager for AI Research, designing and developing solutions in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning, natural language understanding, and document understanding. I also co-founded [**Skillprompt**](https://www.skillprompt.com/), where I led cross-functional teams to deliver technology solutions.

My research and professional work span peer-reviewed publications, patent applications, deployed AI solutions, and AI education initiatives.
